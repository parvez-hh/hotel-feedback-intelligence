## Brief Description & Idea

### Problem Statement
Hotels receive guest feedback across fragmented external channels such as TripAdvisor, Google Reviews, Booking.com, and private post-stay surveys. Without a centralized system, operational teams face delayed responses, unaddressed guest grievances, lost revenue opportunities, and an inability to track cross-channel reputation metrics efficiently.

### Solution Overview
The **Hotel Guest Feedback Intelligence Platform** is an external multi-channel feedback aggregator and sentiment intelligence system designed for hotel operational teams. It automatically aggregates guest reviews from multiple external platforms into a unified dashboard, categorizes guest sentiment using automated text analysis, and alerts staff to urgent operational grievances.

### Key Features
* **Multi-Channel Review Aggregation:** Centralizes external reviews from Google, TripAdvisor, Booking.com, and custom post-stay surveys into a unified timeline.
* **Automated Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies reviews by sentiment score (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and operational tags (e.g., Housekeeping, Dining, Staff, Amenities).
* **Urgent Action Desk:** Escalates high-priority negative reviews into actionable tickets for hotel staff resolution.
* **Reputation Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes cross-channel rating trends, department-level performance metrics, and sentiment distribution over time.
* **Response Management:** Allows hotel managers to draft and track response statuses (Pending, Responded, Escalated) for external reviews.

## Day-by-Day Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation & Setup
* **Day 1:** Initialize repository, structure project directories, and configure environment variables for Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas.
* **Day 2:** Set up database schemas using Mongoose for `Reviews`, `Channels`, `Users`, and `ActionTickets`.
* **Day 3:** Build REST API endpoints for review CRUD operations and channel filtering (`/api/reviews`).
* **Day 4:** Create mock data generators to simulate incoming external reviews from TripAdvisor, Google, and Booking.com.
* **Day 5:** Setup backend authentication routes (JWT-based signup/login) and password hashing with `bcryptjs`.

### Week 2: Core Features & Logic
* **Day 6:** Implement server-side sentiment analysis and auto-tagging logic for incoming review text.
* **Day 7:** Initialize React frontend using Vite/CRA, setup react-router-dom, and establish the main layout and navigation bar.
* **Day 8:** Build the core **Unified Feedback Feed** component with filtering by channel, rating, and operational category.
* **Day 9:** Develop the **Reputation Analytics Dashboard** using Chart.js/Recharts to display sentiment breakdowns and average ratings.
* **Day 10:** Create the **Urgent Action Desk** interface for managing flagged negative reviews and assigning staff resolution statuses.

### Week 3: Refinement, Integration & Testing
* **Day 11:** Integrate frontend components with Express backend endpoints and handle API loading/error states cleanly.
* **Day 12:** Implement review response drafting tools allowing managers to mark reviews as "Responded" with recorded timestamps.
* **Day 13:** Add input validation across forms (Zod/Joi) and secure API endpoints with authentication middleware.
* **Day 14:** Perform full end-to-end testing across all user workflows, fix UI/UX bugs, and optimize database indexing.
* **Day 15:** Finalize application documentation, record deployment setup, and prepare the project demo.
